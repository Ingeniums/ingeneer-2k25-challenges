 Bound in ancient dragonhide and sealed with cursed silver, the Grimorium Verum is a forbidden tome whispered about in hushed tones within the Restricted Section. Said to contain incantations that twist the fabric of reality, it details the darkest branches of magicâ€”binding souls, conjuring illusions that breathe, and bending time at a terrible price. Its authorship is unknown, and the book is rumored to write back when challenged.
