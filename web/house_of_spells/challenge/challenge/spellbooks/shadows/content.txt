 An obsidian-black volume that absorbs light around it, the Codex of Shadows chronicles the many unseen forces that drift through the wizarding world. It offers insight into shadowmancy, a rare and treacherous art, including the manipulation of silhouettes, veils, and the remnants of lingering spells. Many who study its pages report seeing figures out of the corner of their eyeâ€”and some never stop seeing them.
