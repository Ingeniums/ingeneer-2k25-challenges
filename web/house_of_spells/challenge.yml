  While wandering the castle one evening, you found a room you’d never noticed before. Its door stood ajar, warm to the touch, with a faded sign above it: House of Spells.  Inside, an enchanted display listed spells by house — but the magic flickered. For a moment, something strange surfaced beneath: broken runes, forgotten enchantments... or protections long since unraveled.
