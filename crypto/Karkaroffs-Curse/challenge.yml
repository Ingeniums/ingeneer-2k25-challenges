description: |
  The Death Eaters left behind a cursed cipher, said to be used by traitors like Karkaroff to send fragmented secrets.
  Each piece is bound with Dark RSA magic and sealed with twisted MD5 incantations.
  “Only those who can wield Dark Magic can break it,” they claimed.
  Prove them wrong — decipher the curse and recover the hidden message.
