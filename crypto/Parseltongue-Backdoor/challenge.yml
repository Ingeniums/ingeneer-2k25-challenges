  Greetings, Harry Potter!  
  Weâ€™ve been waiting for you.  

  Hidden in this enchanted forest are magical challenges crafted just for *The Boy Who Lived*.  
  But beware â€” dark forces stir, and impostors wield forbidden spells to masquerade as mighty wizards.  

  To prove youâ€™re the true Harry, you must speak Parseltongue, the ancient tongue of serpents.  
  The guardian snake has hissed a cryptic secret:  
  ðŸ”’ Parseltongue: `1K2NQRS_CXN25OUAEEOXGR{CEPLUIX3EY_R_TGLXNEOUEDONS}`  

  Decipher its meaning to unlock the path.  

  Only then will the forest yield to you.
