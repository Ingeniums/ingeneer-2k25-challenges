  # LuckyDice-v0
  a intro flutter reverse challenge, should be "easy" O_o       
  How Dart compiles and packages code remains a mystery to many.       
  But sometimes, a well-placed const might just light the way to the jackpot. ðŸ’¡       

  ## Tips
  - use `genymotion` for the emulation (for the ppl who are new to this) 
  - looks like my `main.dart` file got leaked. those damn hackers `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
  - i decided to re-write [Saif's](https://github.com/Ingeniums/IngeHack-2k25-Challenges/tree/main/reverse/dados) challenge in flutter, Of course, it's not the same challenge but it might help some beginners get started. ofc Java and flutter are two totally different beasts
