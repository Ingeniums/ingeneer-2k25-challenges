  During a clandestine lesson in the Forbidden Forest, Professor Moody gathers the apprentices for a test of perception and logic.

  > *"Among these ancient trees, some bear the Phantom Mark—a dark sigil invisible to the one who stands beneath it. Each of you will be assigned a tree, but you cannot see your own. Look around: How many marks do you see?"*

  - **Alice** counts **A** marked trees.
  - **Bob** counts **B** marked trees.

  The total number of marks, **T**, is either **X** or **Y** (X < Y), but neither knows for sure.

  **The Ritual of Declaration:**
  Each night, the professor asks the apprentices in Turn:
  > *"Is the true number of marks **X** or **Y**?"*

  If an apprentice can logically deduce the answer, they must declare it at midnight. If not, the ritual repeats.

  **Your Task:**
  Given **A**, **B**, **X**, and **Y**, determine the **minimum number of nights** before one apprentice can conclusively declare the true count.

  **Input Format:**
  * Line 1: Two integers **A** and **B** (0 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^9)
  * Line 2: Two integers **X** and **Y** (1 ≤ X < Y ≤ 10^18)

  **Output Format:**
  * A single integer: the number of nights required.

  > *The flag is forged from the answers to hidden trials, wrapped in `1ng3neer2k25{}`.*
