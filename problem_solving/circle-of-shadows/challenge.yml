  In a secret Defense Against the Dark Arts exercise, `N` apprentice wizards are arranged in a circle by Professor Lupin.

  > "At least one of you is marked by a dark enchantment."

  Says Professor Lupin.

  Everyone looks around, magically examining every other wizard robe, but not their own.

  Professor Lupin continues:

  > "If you are certain that your robe is marked, step forward."

  No wizard steps forward.

  Professor Lupin repeats himself a second time:

  > "If you are certain that your robe is marked, step forward."

  No one again... He proceeds to repeat himself **k-times**,
  facing the same answer. The **(k+1)st-time** is different though, and those in doubt finally stepped.

  How many wizards are marked?

  **Input Format:**
  * The first line contains a single integer: N - the number of wizards
  * The second line contains a single integer: K - the number of repetitions

  **Output Format:**
  * A single integer: the number of marked wizards
