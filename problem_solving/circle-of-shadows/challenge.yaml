  ### Challenge: Circle of Shadows

  In a secret Defense Against the Dark Arts exercise, N apprentice wizards are arranged in a circle by Professor Lupin.

  > "At least one of you is marked by a dark enchantment."

  Says Professor Lupin.

  Everyone looks around, magically examining every other wizard robe.

  Professor Lupin continues:

  > "If you are certain that your robe is marked, step forward."

  No wizard steps forward.

  Professor Lupin repeats himself a second time:

  > "If you are certain that your robe is marked, step forward."

  Some, but not all wizards step forward. He proceeds to repeat himself k-times,
  facing the same answer. The (k+1)st-time is different though, and those in doubt finally stepped.

  How many wizards are marked?

  **Input Format:**
