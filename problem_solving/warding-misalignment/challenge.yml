  In your final Defense Against the Dark Arts practical exam, Professor Lupin tasks you with analyzing the magical perimeter defense grid around Hogwarts. Each ward is represented by a line segment, and pairs of wards can interfere with each other if placed carelessly.

  Your job is to examine the grid and detect these **ward collisions**.

  You are given a list of `N` ward segments (guaranteed to be even), each defined by two endpoints.

  You must only compare **consecutive, non-overlapping pairs**: (0 & 1), (2 & 3), ..., (N−2 & N−1). If a pair **collides**, append `(i + i+1) % 10` to the flag, where `i` is the index of the first ward in the pair.

  The final flag is formed as:

  `1ng3neer2k25{` + `collision digits` + `}`

  > Detect the warding misalignment. Secure the perimeter. Reveal the flag.

  **Input Format:**
  * The first line contains a single integer `N` — number of ward pairs.
  * The next `N` lines contain four integers `x1 y1 x2 y2` — the endpoints of each ward.

  **Output Format:**
  * A single line: the generated flag.
