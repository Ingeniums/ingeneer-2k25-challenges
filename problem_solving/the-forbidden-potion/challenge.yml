  Deep within the dungeons of Hogwarts, Professor Snape challenges his most gifted students with a subtle alchemical riddle.

  > *"A true defensive elixir is only possible when balance is perfect. Four ingredients—distinct and pure—must come together in harmony. Their value must not only sum to stability but multiply into equilibrium."*

  The price of each ingredient is measured in **Galleons**, and they must satisfy **two strict conditions**:

  - Their **sum** is exactly **9.81 Galleons**
  - Their **product** is also **9.81 Galleons**

  **Your Task:**
  Find 4 **four distinct positive prices**, each to two decimal places, that satisfy both constraints.
